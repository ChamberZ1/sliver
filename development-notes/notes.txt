# Project Notes

- For this project, we assume we already have access to a compromised target.
- C2 frameworks are used after initial exploitation to maintain access.
- Focus is on post-exploitation evasion, not initial access.
- C2 framework is communication framework between attacker and compromised host.
- Implant: The malware/payload dropped on the target machine.
- Beacon vs Session Implant:
  - Beacon: Periodically checks in, more stealthy.
  - Session: Maintains persistent reverse shell.
- Stager: Lightweight loader that fetches the full implant.
- Listener: Server-side process that waits for implants/stagers to connect.
- An implant must be active for a listener to interact with it and for a session to remain alive.
- Default payloads are easily detected.
- Defender AV is NOT the same as a full EDR. It lacks deep behavioral and network telemetry. Endpoint Detection Systems are a lot harder to evade, according to my mentors and the internet. 
- Persistence (e.g., implant re-running after reboot) = backdoor.
- Backdoor is not a C2 necessarily, but C2 needs backdoor/implant.

## Sliver
- open-source
- one of the most used C2 frameworks currently due to its features and accessibility

## Useful commands
- `jobs` – View active listeners
- `profiles` – View implant profiles
- `generate` – Create payload
- `mtls` – generate mutual TLS listener, by default uses port 443 if it has the permissions 
- 'sessions' - View active sessions
