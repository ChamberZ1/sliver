Feb 14 - Decided to use Windows 11 image for victim machine. Windows due to its wide usage in the world. Virtual machine so that it is in a controlled environment. I also changed the victim machine (w11vi) network settings to "Host-Only" by changing the Adapter to Host-Only Adapter. This is to keep the VM offline but open to C2 communication. I wanted to keep the VM offline because Caeland brought to my awareness that connecting the victim device to the internet opens it up to attacks from actual attackers and that may affect my host machine, which I didn't want. So by setting my victim's machine IP to 192.168.56.100 (192.168.56.x range since subnet mask is (255.255.255.0 (/24)) ) and its default gateway to 192.168.56.1 (my host IP), so that the host (C2 server) and victim can communicate.
